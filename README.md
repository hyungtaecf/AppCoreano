I've created this project when I started learning Korean at Sun Moon Korean Language Institute, in order to help me to memorize words.
It's a quite simple program, that loads word sets to do quizzes. It loads randomly the words in the set and verifies if the answer is right or wrong.
When the answer is write, the word disappears from the quiz, so when all the words disappear, the quiz ends.

## Skills

- Java Application with some Class Relations
- Database Concept of Many-To-Many (one word can have many translations)
